        <p><em>I have been working in the printing industry for <strong>30
              years.</strong> I have mainly worked in the bindery department running various machines.
            I am more skilled in folders but I do run paper cutters, saddle-stitchers trimmers.
            I have even have several years in the mailing department as well running inserters and inkjets.

  <p>I began in the printing industry in the summer of 1989. I worked at Ross
    Printing & Marketing as a cutter operator for the first year then I was
    asked if I wanted to work on a Didde Forms Web Press. I did this for another
    year and had worked my way up to <strong>second pressman.</strong></p>
  <p>While working there, I worked with a bindery person who was an expert at
    running the bindery machines. I told myself that I wanted to be as good as
    he was but I wanted to know more. Now that I have come to the 30 year mark
    in this career, I have completed what I wanted to do with these skills.</p>
