        <p><em>I have been working in the printing industry as a bindery machine operator for <strong>30
              years</strong> running various machines and handwork projects.
            Folders is the main skill set however, I do run paper cutters, saddle-stitchers trimmers as well.
            I have spent several years running inserters and inkjets within the mailing department.
        </p>

  <p>I began in the printing industry in the summer of 1989. I started as a cutter operator for the first year then moved to the Didde Forms Web-Press working 
    as a presshelper for about 4 months then worked my way up to <strong>second pressman.</strong></p>
  <p>While working there, I worked with a man who was an expert at
    running the bindery machines. I told myself I wanted to be as good, if not better as
    he was. Now that I have come to the 30 year mark
    in my career, I completed what I wanted to do by learning most of the skills needed to run the bindery..</p>
  <p>Throughout the years, I have maintained a bindery machine operator position while guiding others as a lead and/or supervisor position.</p>
