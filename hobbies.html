        <h4>I have not read this website but I will. It looks good however, Self Inquiry practices that Ramana Maharshi taught are the basics of all my meditations. They are most direct and can keep you on track no matter what the expeirences may arise within ones self.</h4>
        <li><a href="https://www.siftingtothetruth.com/blog/2019/6/7/the-ultimate-guide-to-spiritual-self-inquiry">Self Inquiry</a></li>
        <h4>There are three types of meditation I practice. The first one <em>expansion.</em> It is to self expand into the universal consciousness.  This becomes a pieceful experience. I had a cat who would try and sit on my lap during these meditations and purr really loud.</h4>
        <h4>The second type of meditation I will sometimes practice is what I call Shakti Meditation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti#:~:text=%22Energy%2C%20ability%2C%20strength%2C,that%20is%20creative%2C%20sustaining%2C%20as">Shakti</a>
        Shakti Mediation is where I sit and draw in all the energy within the Universe into my crown chakra. By doing this for long periods of time, you will begin to feel fire hot shards spike along your spine. This will definitely get your attention. There were times when I would do this for many hours and I would begin to sweat and everything looked like I was underwater. Moving around and swirling. My cat would come close to me when I would practice this meditation and her eyes would become large and she would run fast as she could away from me.</h4>
        <h4>The thrid type of meditation is what I call inter-Steller Mind. This is where I just relax and let my mind travel to whatever form of reality and experience it as it is. It could be traveleing through space and time, or different ancient time frames here on Earth or even dimensional unexplained realities.</h4>
        <h4>No matter which type of meditation I would be practicing, the Self Inquiry teaching of Ramana Maharshi is to be kept in mind at all times.</h4>
